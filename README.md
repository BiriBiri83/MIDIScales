# MIDIScales
Simple python script based on random limited by some music theory. Can generate melodies on given harmony or generate a random new one. Can generate melodies with different modes (I hope so) such as major, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, minor and finnaly locrian. Even at the same time. After generation creates a .txt file with notes and time.
